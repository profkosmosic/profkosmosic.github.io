                    <h2>WEB DESIGN AND PROGRAMMING</h2>
                    <p>Through ICT College I have acquired a much better understanding and a firmer grasp of programming as a concept and I have went on to write programs and develop websites of my own very shortly after. As of now I have made one full website using <i class="important">HTML</i> and <i class="important">CSS</i>, written many lines of code in both <i class="important">C</i> and <i class="important">C#</i> and built several games on my own, one of which so far has been released publicly.</p>

                    <h2>GAME DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <p>Game development has been a hobby of mine since I was in primary school and is the main reason why today I have an interest in programming. I mostly use <i class="important">Unity</i> and <i class="important">Game Maker Studio</i> when I want to make my own games from scratch, but sometimes I also modify already existing games such as Half-Life 2 (<i class="important">Source Engine</i>) by making new levels or editing/replacing the game's textures and such.</p>

                    <h2>VIDEO EDITING</h2>
                    <p>I have been making and editing videos as assignments since the beginning of high school. I have experience using both <i class="important">Sony Vegas</i> and <i class="important">Adobe Premiere</i> for editing(green screen, syncing etc.) and <i class="important">Adobe After Effects</i> for all kinds of VFX. Though many of my works have either been deleted to save space or lost over the years, I have kept the most recent video that I have edited together for my finals.</p>

                        <p>My first released project made in Unity. It is a Horror game that puts you in the shoes of a security guard working at the fictional SCP Facility trying to recontain a dangerous creature. The first version was made in only 2 days, but the game has received major updates since then.</p>

                        <p>My second Unity project that is coming soon. It's a prologue to a very flashy First Person Shooter game about organizations battling eachother by letting hitmen do their bidding. It's my biggest and most time consuming project to date in every way, from design to coding.</p>

                        <p>The only game that I'm currently working on in Game Maker Studio. It is in its early stages of development, having no real levels and the only things present being a debug mode for testing the AI and other mechanics. It draws influences heavily from games like Hotline Miami.</p>
